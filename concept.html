    <p>Welcome to my p5.js video exploration project! In this project, I have created five different video filters using
        the
        p5.js library. Each filter has a unique style and inspiration.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The first filter is TEXTIFY!, which allows the user to input their own text and see it displayed in a creative
        way. The
        second filter is WARHOL!, inspired by the famous artist Andy Warhol and his bold, colorful pop art style. The
        third
        filter is POP!, another pop art-inspired filter with bright colors and patterns. The fourth filter is VERTEX!,
        which
        utilizes real colors from the video to create a unique and dynamic effect. The fifth filter is SKETCH!, a black
        and
        white vertex filter that creates a sketch-like effect on the video.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I had a lot of fun exploring the capabilities of p5.js and experimenting with different filter styles. I hope
        you enjoy
        trying out the filters and discovering the possibilities of video exploration with p5.js.</p>
